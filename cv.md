## About me

I graduated from Izhevsk State Technical University with a degree in Industrial and Civil Engeneering in 2019. 
By the end of my studies, I was understanding I don't wanna work in this direction. 
Since April 2020, I started learning English, because this is one of the very important skills in my future profession - Frontend/Fullstack software developer.   

## Experience 

I have no experience with real tasks, but sometimes I made  simple apps on JS. For example:
* Online calculator
* Online translator
* Some algorithms with numbers  
Unfortunatelly, I haven't saved these apps.

## English 

Pre-intermediate (A2)
